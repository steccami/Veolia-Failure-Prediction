# Veolia-Failure-Prediction

Here you can find the data of the project in the folder Data.

An exploratory analysis notebook, a script functions.py with functions I used to preprocess and 
creatre new features

A notebook "Models" that is trying to show what kind of models we applied.

I didn't try to optimize everything with gridsearch and Kfold validation 
because the point was just to show you what kind of methods we used to tackle the problem.
